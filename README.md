# SlashInternshipTask
This repo contains the task for Slash Winter Internship 2024


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    git clone (https://github.com/KarimAbouzeid/SlashInternshipTask.git)
    ```
